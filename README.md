# odilon
Object Storage Open Source

Odilon is a scalable and lightweight Open Source Object Storage that runs on standard hardware.

It is an infrastructure software to be used by applications that need to store large amounts of unstructured digital objects such as pdf, MS Word, XLSX files, backups, videos, photos or audio.

Odilon was designed for enterprise software that needs to store terabytes of medium to large size objects (like photos or pdfs) securely and safely through encryption, replication and redundancy. A typical installation would by 100M pdfs 20KB-30MB each.

It has a simple single-level folder structure similar to the Bucket / Object model of Amazon S3. It is small and easy to integrate, offers encryption, data protection and fault tolerance (software RAID and Erasure Codes) and detection of silent data degradation. Odilon also supports version control and master - standby replication over the Internet for disaster recovery and anti ransomware.

**Main features**

 Scalable Object Storage on commodity disks
 Developed in Java 11 (uses Spring Boot, OkHttp, Jackson, Metrics, among others)
 Runs on Linux and Windows
 SDK Java 11 for client applications
 HTTP/S for client server communication
 License Open Source Apache 2. It can be used for Open Source and commercial projects
 Encryption at rest (AES 256)
 Integration with Key Management Server Hashicorp Vault
 Simple operation. Adding new disks requires one line in the config file, and an async process sets up disks and replicata data in background
 Data replication using Erasure Coding and software RAID
 Data immutability. Odilon supports two storage modes that protect data from deletion, whether accidental or intentional: Read Only and WORM (Write Once Read Many)
 Master - Standby architecture with async replication over the web, for disaster recovery, high availability, archival, anti-ransomware protection
 Version Control
 Tolerates full disk failures
 Disk monitoring for silent and slow data degradation detection (bit rot detection)

**Security**
Odilon keeps objects encrypted (Encryption at Rest) using modern algorithms such as AES-256. Each object has a unique encryption key. In turn, the encryption key of the object can be generated by Odilon or, which is recommended for greater security, by a Key Management Server (KMS)

A KMS is software for generating, distributing, and managing cryptographic keys. It includes back-end functionality for key generation, distribution, and replacement, as well as client-side functionality for injecting keys, storing, and managing keys on devices. Moving key management to KMS prevents application reverse engineering attacks, simplifies operational maintenance, and compliance with security policies and regulations.

Odilon integrates with the KMS Open Source Hashicorp Vault.

Communication from source to storage is via HTTPS, which uses encryption to increase the security of data transfers (this functionality requires Java 17 and v2.0 02/2024).
