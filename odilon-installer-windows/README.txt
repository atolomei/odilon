Welcome to Odilon
-----------------

Odilon is an Open Source Object Storage that runs on standard hardware.
It was designed as a redundant and secure file storage for applications that need to manage medium to large size objects (like pdfs, photos, audio, video).
It is small and easy to integrate, offers encryption, data protection and fault tolerance (software RAID and Erasure Codes) and detection of silent data degradation. Odilon also supports version control and master - standby replication over the Internet.
